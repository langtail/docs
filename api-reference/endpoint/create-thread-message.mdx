title: "Create Thread Message"
openapi: "POST /v2/threads/{threadId}/messages"

This endpoint allows you to add a message to thread. This will not call the LLM - you can use the [Invoke Assistant API](api-reference/endpoint/invoke-assistant) to add messages and get a response from LLM at the same time.
