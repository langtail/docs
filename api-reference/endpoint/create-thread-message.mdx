title: "Create Thread Message"
openapi: "POST /v2/threads/{threadId}/messages"

Use this endpoint to add a message to a thread without calling the LLM.

In most cases, you should use the [Invoke Assistant API](api-reference/endpoint/invoke-assistant) to add messages and get a response from the LLM.
However, this endpoint is useful when you need to add messages without immediate LLM processing, such as for creating placeholder messages or updating thread content separately.
