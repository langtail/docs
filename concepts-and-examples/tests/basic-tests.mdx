[Here is a prompt](https://app.langtail.com/playground?shareid=U_-cFxHZwq) that that analyzes the sentiment of some text and returns a JSON object containing that sentiment. Here's what a basic set of tests could look like:

![Screenshot of Langtail's test section](/images/tests/overview/screenshot.png)

1. **Test 1 - Positive Sentiment**

   * **Case**: "I am happy."

   * **Assertion**: An *equals* assertion with the value `{"sentiment": "positive"}`

2. **Test 2 - Positive Sentiment**

   * **Case**: "I am sad."

   * **Assertion**: An *equals* assertion with the value `{"sentiment": "negative"}`

3. **Test 3 - Is Valid JSON**

   * **Case**: "I saw a blue car."

   * **Assertion**: A *javascript* assertion with the following code:```javascript
     test(async ({ message, variables }) => {
       try {
             JSON.parse(message.content);
             return true; // Parsing succeeded, so it's valid JSON
         } catch (e) {
             return false; // Parsing failed, so it's not valid JSON
         }
     });
     ```

There's a lot more that could be tested, but having even a basic test suite for each of your prompts can be a great way to safeguard against typos (like misspelling "positive") or parameter changes (like turning off JSON mode).
