title: 'Integrate via Node.js SDK'
---

<Note>If you aren't using JavaScript for your project, you can still use the [REST API](/api-reference/endpoint/invoke-deployed-prompt) to invoke a deployment.</Note>

You can invoke a prompt deployment using Langtail's Node.js SDK. Here's how to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the SDK in your project (using NPM or your package manager of choice):
    ```bash
    npm add @langtail/node
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define environment variables">
    In your project, define the following environment variables. These names are just a suggestion and can be changed if desired.

      - **LANGTAIL_API_KEY**: The project-level API key
      - **LANGTAIL_PROMPT_SLUG**: The slug of the prompt that you want to invoke
      - **LANGTAIL_ENV**: The specific environment that you want to invoke. Valid values are *preview*, *staging*, and *production*. You can also add `?v=VERSION` if you want to pin to a specific deployment.

    You can find the prompt slug and env in the *Deployments* tab of your prompt:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Invoke the deployment">
    TODO - show how to use the autogenerated code from the app to integrate into your app.
  </Step>
