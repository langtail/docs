title: 'Invoke via Langtail SDK'
---

<Note>If you aren't using JavaScript for your project, you can still use the [REST API](/api-reference/endpoint/invoke-deployed-prompt) to invoke a deployment.</Note>

You can invoke a prompt deployment using Langtail's Node.js SDK. Here's how to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a code snippet">
    In Langtail, generate an SDK code snippet for your deployment:

    1. Navigate to the prompt you want to invoke.
    1. Click *Deployments* tab in the navigation bar.
    1. Next to the deployment you want to invoke, click the *...* and then *View Code*.
    1. In the language selector, choose *JavaScript SDK*.
    1. If you don't already have a Langtail project API key, you can generate one with the *Get API Key* button.
    1. Copy the snippet.

    <video
      controls
      className="w-full aspect-video"
      src="/images/deployments/invoke-sdk/copy-sdk-snippet.mp4"
    ></video>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Langtail SDK">
    In your project directory, install the SDK  (using NPM or your package manager of choice):
    ```bash
    npm add @langtail/node
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste and run">
    In your project, paste in the snippet from the first step and run your project. Check the Langtail logs to see if the request from your app was processed correctly.
  </Step>
