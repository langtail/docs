title: 'Create a Deployment'

Deploying your prompt creates a dedicated API endpoint that uses your Prompt Template. You can call this API with just the variables, making integration to your app much easier!

Thanks to the Cloudflare Global network, these API benefit from low latency and reliable, high availability.

<Steps>

    Before moving on, make sure you have:

    - You can save the example using the "Save as" button like this:
