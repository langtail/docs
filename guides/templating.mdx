## Introduction

In Langtail, templating with Handlebars helps you build smarter, dynamic prompts for LLM apps. It's straightforward: templates let your prompts change based on the data they get. This means you can handle complex cases without writing tons of code.

### **Why it's useful:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Dynamic Content:">
    Use variables to personalize prompts based on user input or context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conditional Content:">
    Include or exclude parts of your prompts depending on the situation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt Variations:">
    Quickly test different ways of asking or responding without redoing your
    work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Templating makes your LLM apps more adaptable. Let's get into how you can use Handlebars in Langtail to make this happen.

## Setting Up Your Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Langtail and select your project." />
  <Step title="Navigate to 'Prompts' to either open an existing prompt or create a new one." />
  <Step title="In the 'Template' section, craft your prompt.">
    Utilize Handlebars syntax and variables for dynamic content creation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```django Example
Hello, {{name}}!
```

That's it. You're ready to use templating.

## Simple Templating with Variables

Use variables to customize prompts based on user input or context, making your interactions with GPT models more dynamic.

- **Inserting Variables:**
  - Syntax: `{{variableName}}`
  - **Example:** To customize a chatbot response, you might use:

```django Example
Hello, {{userName}}! How can I assist you today?
```

## Using Conditionals in Templates

Conditionals in your templates allow for dynamic changes in the prompts based on specific input data you send to the LLM. This enables you to tailor the interaction based on predefined conditions.

- **Basic Conditionals:**
  - Syntax: `{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}`
  - **Example:** If you're creating a prompt where the response varies based on the time of day provided as input, you might use:

```django Example
{{#if (lt hour 12)}}
Good morning! How can I assist you today?
{{else}}
Good afternoon! How can I assist you today?
{{/if}}
```

In this example, `hour` is a variable that you would set based on the user's
local time before sending the prompt to the LLM.

## Section 4: Advanced Conditionals with Helpers

For more complex logic within your Langtail prompts, you can use Handlebars helpers. These helpers allow you to perform operations like comparison, logical AND/OR, and more, enabling sophisticated control over the content of your prompts based on the input data.

### Using Helpers

Helpers like `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte`, `and`, `or` can be used to evaluate conditions more intricately.

- **Syntax for Helpers:**
  - `{{#if (helperName arg1 arg2)}}...{{/if}}`
  - Helpers are used within the `{{#if ...}}` block to evaluate conditions.

### Examples

#### Equality Check (eq)

- **Purpose:** Check if two values are equal.
- **Example:** Customize prompt based on user subscription status.
  ```django Example
  {{#if (eq subscriptionStatus 'active')}}
    "Thank you for being a valued subscriber! Here's what's new..."
  {{else}}
    "Consider subscribing to get full access."
  {{/if}}
  ```

#### Greater Than (gt)

- **Purpose:** Check if one value is greater than another.
- **Example:** Offer content based on user's score.
  ```django Example
  {{#if (gt userScore 50)}}
    "Great job! You scored above 50!"
  {{else}}
    "Try again to score more than 50."
  {{/if}}
  ```

#### Logical AND (and)

- **Purpose:** Check if multiple conditions are true.
- **Example:** Provide options based on user's age and consent.
  ```django Example
  {{#if (and (gte userAge 18) (eq consentGiven true))}}
    "You have access to all features."
  {{else}}
    "Some features may be restricted."
  {{/if}}
  ```

#### Logical OR (or)

- **Purpose:** Check if at least one of multiple conditions is true.
- **Example:** Adjust prompt based on user's role.
  ```django Example
  {{#if (or (eq userRole 'admin') (eq userRole 'moderator'))}}
    "Access to admin controls granted."
  {{else}}
    "Standard user access."
  {{/if}}
  ```

By using these helpers, you can create prompts that directly respond to the input data. This approach allows for more precise and relevant LLM interactions.
