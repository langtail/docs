This section explains the main concepts in Langtail. If you are new to LLMs or prompt development, start from this glossary to familiarize yourself with the terminology.

### API keys	
API Keys used to authenticate to Langtail. Can be generated here or from Deployments tab.

### Assertion	
A single condition that returns true or false. Valid types are `equals`, `contains`, `icontains`, and `javascript`.

### Config	
A set of different prompt parameters that will be used in the test.

### Deploy	
Creates a deployment of the selected prompt version.

### Deployment	
A prompt version that is available on the Langtail API.

### Environment	
An alias to a deployment. For example, the production API URL stays the same but is served by different deployments over time.

### Log	
A single execution of a deployment. This allows you to see some metadata, the request to Langtail, the request to the provider, and the response from the provider.

### Member	
A user in Langtail.

### Message	
A specific type of template that is only used in the playground and not deployed with the prompt version.

### Metric	
Aggregated data about activity in the prompt or project. 

### Model	
A LLM model that will be used to run the prompt.

### Output	
The result of running a single test case. Either Success or Fail.

### Parameter	
A single setting for the prompt. For example, model or temperature.

### Playground	
An interface to easily edit and run a prompt. You can add templates, messages, variables, tools, and modify parameters.

### Preview deployment	
A specific environment called preview.

### Production deployment	
A specific environment called production.

### Project	
A collection of prompts. Also contains project-level API keys (shared across prompts) and an aggregated view of metrics and logs (from all prompts).

### Prompt	
A collection of parameters, templates, messages, variables, and tools. Sent as a single request to the model.	

### Prompt version	
A single version of a prompt which includes everything except for the messages entered in the playground. A user can revert back to a version at any time.

### Provider	
The host of more models.

### Provider key	
API key used to authenticate to the provider .

### Response	
The response from the provider.

### Save	
Saves a new prompt version.

### Send	
Sends all of the data from the currently selected prompt to the model and adds the response as a new message in the playground .

### Share	
Allows a member to share a prompt with someone else.

### Staging 
deployment	A specific environment called staging.

### Template	
A text string that is part of a prompt. Valid types are system, assistant, user, function, and tool.

### Test	
A collection of configs, assertions and test cases. When run, each individual case is compared against every config and assertion and shows an output.

### Test case	
A user message  and/or variable values which are executed with the prompt version that is being tested. When run, it returns an output.

### Tool	
A single custom function definition. Based on the user message, the provider can invoke this function to get external data or provide extra functionality.

### Variable	
Text that can be inserted into a template and changed dynamically when run.

### Workspace	
A collection of projects.

### Workspace settings	
Settings for a workspace where you can manage members and provider keys.
