title: 'What is Langtail?'
---
Langtail is an LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) platform designed to help teams accelerate the development of AI-powered applications and streamline the process of shipping them to production with fewer surprises. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools and features to manage the entire lifecycle of language models, from experimentation and testing to deployment and monitoring.

**Key Features**

1. **Playground**: Experiment, debug, and collaborate on prompts in a user-friendly environment, allowing teams to iterate and refine their language models efficiently.
2. **Testing**: Create a suite of tests to evaluate how changes to prompt text or LLM parameters affect the application's performance, ensuring consistent and reliable behavior.
3. **Deployments**: Publish prompts as API endpoints, enabling teams to iterate on their language models without redeploying the entire application codebase.
4. **Logs**: Observe real-world user inputs and how the language model responds, providing valuable insights for debugging and improving the model's performance.
5. **Metrics**: Monitor important data points such as latency and cost, allowing teams to optimize their language models for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

**Why Use Langtail?**

Do any of these situations sound familiar?

- I have a text file of sample user inputs and I paste them one by one into my app to see the output “seems good”.
- My teammate from marketing wants to help write prompts but … all of them live in the codebase. So, I paste the prompt into a Google Doc and share it with them. Then copy it back to code when they’re done.
- I have no idea if some users are costing me more money than others. The only data I have available is the monthly spend chart from OpenAI’s billing dashboard.
- My LLM provider released a new version of their model but I’m too nervous to upgrade because I don’t want to break my app.

We are developers ourselves. We know from our own experience (and Twitter) that building great AI-powered products is hard. On top of that, the landscape is changing very quickly and can be overwhelming at times.

**We built Langtail to address the pain points that a team experiences as they take their proof-of-concept and turn it into a real product that can be shipped to production.**
