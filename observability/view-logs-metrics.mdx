## Logs

Whenever a deployment is invoked or a prompt is sent via the proxy, a log is created. You can view logs in two different places:

1. When you open a prompt, click the *Logs* tab in the navigation bar. Here you will see all logs from this prompt.
1. From the project view, click the *Logs* tab on the left sidebar. Here you will see logs from every prompt in the project.

From the logs view, you can use filters to drill down by environment, version, prompt, and more. When you click on a log, you get details about how the prompt was invoked. You can also click the *Open in Playground* button to open it with all of the context from the log.

## Metrics

Just like in the logs, you can view metrics in two different places:

1. When you open a prompt, click the *Metrics* tab in the navigation bar. Here you will see only the metrics from this prompt.
1. From the project view, click the *Metrics* tab on the left sidebar. Here you will see aggregated metrics from every prompt in the project.

You can filter by time in the top right corner of the app.
