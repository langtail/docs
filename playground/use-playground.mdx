title: 'How to use the playground'

The Langtail Playground is a prompt engineer's dream. It offers prompt templating, variables, tools, versioning, sharing - all in a streamlined interface that helps you build and ship faster.

1. **Templates Panel**: Allows you to incorporate System, Assistant, and User templates into your prompt, which are included during deployment. Utilize variables by inserting `{{myVariable}}` into the template and format them using [templating syntax](/playground/templating.mdx).
1. **Variables Panel**: Variables defined within the templates are conveniently listed here. Modify these variables to test and refine your prompt's outputs.
1. **Tools Panel**: Create a custom tool specification that can enrich the AI model's response. If the AI model decides to use the tool, the Assistant response will be a function call. In the playground, you can mock the response, send it back to the model, and see what the final output will be.
1. **Parameters**: Choose an AI model and adjust its parameters to tailor the model's behavior to your needs.
1. **Send**: Click here to execute the entire prompt and display the response.
1. **Messages Area**: This area displays the responses generated by the model following the execution of your prompt.
1. **Save**: Saves the prompt and optionally allows you to create a named version.
1. **Share**: Share your prompt with your team or publicly for the world to see.
1. **Deploy**: Publish your prompt as an API into various environments. After deploying, click the "Deployments" tab to see the API endpoint and how to call it.
1. **Prompt versions**: Access and manage previous versions of your prompt here, with the option to revert if necessary.
