title: 'Integrate via Langtail SDK'
---

<Note>Using the Proxy via the SDK is a quick way to try out Langtail. For a fully-featured experience, we recommend [trying out the full Langtail workflow](/getting-started/quickstart")</Note>

You can invoke a prompt deployment using Langtail's Node.js SDK. Here's how to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a project API key">
    <video
      controls
      className="w-full aspect-video"
      src="/images/proxy/create-api-key.mp4"
    ></video>

    1. In Langtail, open an existing project or create a new one.
    1. In the left sidebar, click *Secrets*.
    1. Click *New API Key*, optionally set a name and a budget limit, then click *Create*.
    1. Copy the key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the Langtail SDK in your project (using NPM or your package manager of choice):
    ```bash
    npm add @langtail/node
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your code to use the SDK">
    1. Add your Langtail project API key to an environment variable. In the following snippets, we use `LANGTAIL_API_KEY`.
    1. In your codebase, paste this snippet:
    ```javascript
    import { Langtail } from "@langtail/node"

    const lt = new Langtail({
      apiKey: process.env.LANGTAIL_API_KEY,
    })

    const rawCompletion = await lt.chat.completions.create({
      // Required
      messages: [{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." }],
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      // Optional:
      // All OpenAI fields (temperature, top_p, tools,...)
      doNotRecord: false, // false will ensure logs do not contain any info about payloads
      metadata: {
        "custom-field": 1,
      },
    })
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test it out">
    Run your app and make a request to verify that everything works properly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Observe metrics and logs">
  <video
      controls
      className="w-full aspect-video"
      src="/images/proxy/view-logs.mp4"
    ></video>

    1. Back in Langtail, navigate to the project and then click *Logs* in the left sidebar.
    1. You should see log entries coming from your app (they have an environment value of "proxy").
    1. Click on a log to see detailed information about the request and response from OpenAI.
    1. If you want to experiment with this prompt, click *Open in Playground*. Here you can change parameters and modify different parts of the prompt and then see the result.
