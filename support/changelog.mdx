  ## 🔧 New Project Settings 🔧

  Managing your projects just got easier! We've added a new item in the project-level sidebar that lets you perform common actions like renaming or deleting a project.

  ## 🛠️ Enhanced Workspace Settings 🛠️

  Your workspace is now even more flexible! We've refined the settings to allow you to rename your workspace and made the UI more consistent across the different sections for a smoother experience.

  ## 📜 Redesigned Logs 📜

  We've completely redesigned our Logs for a cleaner, more user-friendly interface. Plus, Logs now also display the JSON representation of what's being sent from Langtail to end providers like OpenAI. We think you'll love this upgrade as much as we do!

  ## 🔍 OpenAI Tools Support 🔍

  We're thrilled to announce that support for the new OpenAI Tools is here! Functions now visually resemble TypeScript functions and are even typesafe. The types are generated based on the JSON schema. We're confident you'll find them incredibly useful.

  ## 🌟 GPT-4 Vision Now Live 🌟

  We're thrilled to announce that GPT-4 Vision is now live in production! You can now input images along with text, opening up a whole new realm of creative use cases. For instance, take a photo of an invoice and ask for the cost of each item – Vision has you covered.

  ## 🎨 Experimenting with Vision in Playground 🎨

  Want to give Vision a spin? Head over to our Playground and upload an image or insert an image URL. Please note that Vision takes a few seconds to process, so a bit of patience is required.

  ## 🚀 Deploy Prompts with Vision 🚀

  Great news for developers – deploying prompts with Vision in Langtail is now supported!

  ## 🛠️ Workspace Settings and UX Updates 🛠️

  We've also rolled out a couple of key updates for improved user experience:

  * New Workspace Settings: Now, you can manage your provider API keys and team members all in one place.

  * Refined UX for Per API Budget: Based on your feedback, we've refined the UX and terminology for the per API budget. You must now enable the budget before setting the total for your API key and specific user allowances.
