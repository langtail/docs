The Deployments feature in Langtail allows you to publish your prompts as API endpoints, enabling you to iterate on your language models without redeploying the entire application codebase. This streamlines the development process and facilitates seamless integration with other applications or services.

With Deployments, you can create and manage API endpoints for your prompts, configure deployment settings like the language model and parameters, and monitor performance and usage metrics. You can also manage deployment versions and perform rollbacks when needed.

Additionally, Langtail provides an SDK (Software Development Kit) that allows you to interact with your deployed prompts programmatically. The SDK supports various programming languages and enables you to authenticate with the Langtail API, invoke your deployed prompts, handle responses and errors, and perform advanced operations like batching requests and streaming responses.
