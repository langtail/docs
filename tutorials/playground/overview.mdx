The Langtail Playground is a prompt engineer's dream. It offers prompt templating, variables, tools, versioning, sharing, and more in a streamlined interface that helps you build and ship faster.

Here's a quick overview of its interface:

1. **Templates Panel**: Here you can incorporate 'System', 'Assistant', and 'User' templates into your prompts for use during deployment. Insert variables using `{{myVariable}}` and format prompts with the templating syntax.
2. **Parameters Panel**: Here you can choose an AI model and adjust its parameters to tailor the model's behavior to your project.
3. **Variables Panel**: Here you can find and modify the variables defined within your templates to refine your prompt's outputs.
4. **Tools Panel**: Here you can create a custom tool specification that can enrich the AI model's response. If the AI model decides to use the tool, the Assistant response will be a function call. You can mock the response, send it back to the model, and see what the final output will be.
5. **Send**: Click to invoke the prompt and display the response.
6. **Messages Area**: Here you can see the responses generated by the model after invoking the prompt.
7. **Prompt versions**: Here you can access and manage previous versions of your prompt and easily revert if necessary.
8. **Save**: Click to save your prompt and, if desired, create a named version.
9. **Deploy**: Click to publish your prompt as an API into various environments. After deploying, click the "Deployments" tab to see the API endpoint and how to call it.
10. **Share**: Click to share your prompt with your team or publicly for the world to see.
