### Working with Tools


In Langtail, the Tools feature allows you to integrate external functions or APIs into your language model's workflow. This powerful capability enables you to create more sophisticated and context-aware applications by leveraging external data sources or services.

### Getting Started with Tools

To get started with Tools in Langtail, follow these steps:

  loading="lazy"
  title="Supademo Demo"
  allow="clipboard-write"
  frameborder="0"
  webkitallowfullscreen="true"
  mozallowfullscreen="true"
  allowfullscreen
  height="432px"
  width="100%">
</iframe>

<Steps>

    <Step title="Enable the Tools Panel">
    In the bottom-left corner of the Langtail interface, you'll find a button to enable the Tools panel. Click on it, and the Tools panel will appear on the right side of the screen.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a New Tool">
    Click on the "Plus Tool" button to add a new tool to your project.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Tool Manually">
    In Langtail, you can create tools manually by providing a name, description, and specifying the required parameters in a structured format.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate a Tool with AI Assistance">
    Alternatively, you can describe the tool's functionality in plain text, and Langtail can generate the tool function structure for you using its AI capabilities.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test the Tool">
    Once you've added a tool, you can test it by providing sample user inputs. Langtail will evaluate the input and determine if the correct tool function should be called based on your prompt.
    
    <Note>
    While Langtail can simulate the tool function call and evaluate the prompt, actual execution requires backend integration. Langtail 1.0 will introduce custom API support, enabling fully functional tools within the Langtail environment.
    </Note>
    </Step>

### Example: Using the Weather Tool

Let's explore how to use the `get_weather` tool in Langtail:


<Steps>
    <Step title="Add the Weather Tool"> 
        In the Tools panel, click on the "Plus Tool" button and manually create the `get_weather` tool function using the structure provided below.
        ```json
            {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "required": [
                "location"
                ],
                "properties": {
                "unit": {
                    "enum": [
                    "celsius",
                    "fahrenheit"
                    ],
                    "type": "string",
                    "default": "celsius",
                    "description": "The unit of temperature"
                },
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                }
                }
            },
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location"
            }

            ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test the Tool"> 
        In the input field, enter a query related to weather, such as "What's the weather like in San Francisco, CA today?"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Evaluate the Prompt"> 
        Langtail will analyze the input and determine if the `get_weather` tool should be called based on your prompt. If the evaluation is successful, you'll see the tool function call displayed in the output, along with the required parameters (`location` and optionally `unit`).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Simulate the Function Call"> 
        While the actual weather data retrieval won't occur within Langtail, you can simulate the function call and observe the expected output format.
    </Step>
</Steps>
By using Tools in Langtail, you can create more powerful and context-aware language models that can leverage external data sources and services. As Langtail continues to evolve, the upcoming ability to define custom APIs will further enhance the functionality of Tools, allowing you to integrate your language models seamlessly with your backend systems.
